Implement |ShortestPathProblem| so that given a |startLocation| and |endTag|, the minimum cost path corresponds to the shortest path from |startLocation| to \textit{any} location that has the |endTag|.
  
In particular, you need to implement |startState()|, |isEnd(state)|, |successorsAndCosts(state)|.

Recall the separation between search problem (modeling) and search algorithm (inference). You should focus on modeling (defining the |ShortestPathProblem|); the default search algorithm, |UniformCostSearch| (UCS), is implemented for you in |util.py|.

\textbf{What we expect: } An implementation of the |ShortestPathProblem| class.
