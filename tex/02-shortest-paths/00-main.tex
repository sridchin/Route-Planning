\item {\bf Finding Shortest Paths}

We first start out with the problem of finding the shortest path from a \textit{start location} (e.g., the Gates Building) to some end location. In Google Maps, you can only specify a specific end location (e.g., Coupa Cafe at Green Library).
  
In this problem, we want to give the user the flexibility of specifying \textit{multiple} possible end locations by specifying a set of "tags" (e.g., so you can say that you want to go to \textit{any} place with food versus a specific location like Tressider).
