Implement |WaypointsShortestPathProblem| so that given a |startLocation|, set of |waypointTags|, and an |endTag|, the minimum cost path corresponds to the shortest path from |startLocation| to a location with the |endTag|, such that all of |waypointTags| are covered by some location in the path.

Note that a single location can be used to satisfy multiple tags.

Like in Problem 2, you need to implement |startState()|, |isEnd(state)|, and |successorsAndCosts(state)|.

There are many ways to implement this search problem, so you should think carefully about how to design your |State|. We want to optimize for a compact state space so that search is as efficient as possible.

\textbf{What we expect: } An implementation of the |WaypointsShortestPathProblem| class. To get full credit, your implementation must have the right asymptotic dependence on the number of locations and waypoints. Note that your code will timeout if you do this incorrectly.
