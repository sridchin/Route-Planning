\item \points{4d}

Recall that heuristics are most effective when they are equal to the future cost. Consider a $n \times n$ grid map (|createGridMap|) where the start and end are at the opposite corners; for $n = 10$, we would have |startLocation = "0,0"|, |endTag = "label=9,9"|.

Provide a concrete example of $n$ |waypointTags| so that running A* with the |NoWaypointsHeuristic| results in the same running time complexity as solving the relaxed shortest path problem.

\textbf{What we expect: } An example of $n$ |waypointTags| that satisfies the constraints of the question.
