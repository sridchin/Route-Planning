We are now ready to speed up search by simply implementing various heuristics. First, implement \\
|StraightLineHeuristic| for Problem 2, which returns the straight line distance from a state to any location with the end tag. Note: you might want to precompute some things so that evaluating the heuristic is fast.

\textbf{What we expect: } An implementation of the |StraightLineHeuristic| class.
