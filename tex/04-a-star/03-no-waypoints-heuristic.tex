Next, implement |NoWaypointsHeuristic| for Problem 3, which returns the minimum cost path from a state to any location with the end tag but ignoring all the waypoints (essentially the solution to Problem 2, so you can reuse that if you'd like). Note: you might want to precompute some things so that evaluating the heuristic is fast. Helpful comments are provided in the code.

\textbf{What we expect: } An implementation of the |NoWaypointsHeuristic| class.
