\item \points{4a}

In this problem, you will implement A* to speed up the search. Recall that in class, A* is just UCS with a different cost function (a new search problem), so we will implement A* via a \textit{reduction} to UCS.

In particular, you should implement |aStarReduction()| which takes a search |problem| and a |heuristic| as input and returns a new search problem.

\textbf{What we expect: } An implementation of the |NewSearchProblem| class in the |aStarReduction(problem, heuristic)| function. As in prior problems, you need to implement |startState()|, |isEnd(state)|, and |successorsAndCosts(state)|.
