\item \points{1b}
How will Uniform Cost Search (UCS) behave on this problem? Mark the following as true or false:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item UCS will never terminate because the number of states is infinite.
    \item UCS will return the minimum cost path and explore only locations between $(0,0)$ and $(m,n)$; that is, $(x,y)$ such that $0 \le x \le m$ and $0 \le y \le n$.
    \item UCS will return the minimum cost path and explore only locations whose past costs are less than the minimum cost from $(0,0)$ to $(m,n)$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What we expect: } T/F for each subpart.
