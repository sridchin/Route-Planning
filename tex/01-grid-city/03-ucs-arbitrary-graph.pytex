\item \points{1c}
Now consider running UCS on an arbitrary graph. Mark the following as true or false:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If you add a connection between two locations, the minimum distance cannot go up.
    \item If you make the cost of an action from some state small enough (possibly negative), that action will show up in the minimum cost path.
    \item If you increase the cost of each action by 1, the minimum cost path does not change (even though its cost does).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What we expect: } T/F for each subpart.
