\item {\bf Grid City}

Consider an infinite city consisting of locations $(x,y)$ where $x, y$ are integers. From each location $(x,y)$, one can go east, west, north, or south. You start at $(0,0)$ and want to go to $(m, n)$, where $m, n \geq 0$. We can define the following search problem to capture this:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $s_\text{start} = (0,0)$
  \item $\text{Actions}(s) = \{ (+1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, +1), (0, -1) \}$
  \item $\text{Succ}(s, a) = s + a$
  \item $\text{Cost}((x,y), a) = 1 + \max(x, 0)$ (it is more expensive as $x$ increases)
  \item $\text{IsEnd}(s) = \mathbf{1}[s = (m,n)]$
\end{itemize}
