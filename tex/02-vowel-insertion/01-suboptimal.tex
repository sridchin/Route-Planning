\item \points{2a}
Consider the following greedy-algorithm: from left to right, repeatedly pick the
immediate-best vowel insertion for the current vowel-free word, given the
insertion that was chosen for the previous vowel-free word. This algorithm does
{\em not} take into account future insertions beyond the current word.

Show, as in problem 1, that this greedy algorithm is suboptimal, by providing a
realistic counter-example using English text. Make any assumptions you'd like
about |possibleFills| and the bigram cost function, but bigram costs must remain
positive.
